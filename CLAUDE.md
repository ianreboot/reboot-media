**Before marking ANY task complete**: Did you run the appropriate deploy command?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Forms don't send emails** - Currently only console.log, no email integration
- **Geographic targeting missing** - Site is US-focused but PRD requires Asian market focus

## Project Overview

Professional website for Reboot Media's fractional CMO services targeting Asian companies ($500K-$1.5M revenue) seeking American marketing expertise. Bangkok-based advantage for regional focus with US expertise perception. Foundation complete with React/TypeScript/Tailwind setup, dark/light mode, glassmorphism design.

**Core Positioning**: "American Marketing Psychology Expertise That Actually Converts - Without the US Price Tag"
**Target Markets**: Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines (primary); US SMBs (secondary)
**Service Tiers**: Psychology Audit ($5K-$8K) ‚Üí Growth Strategy ($8K-$12K) ‚Üí Fractional CMO ($12K-$18K)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Foundation complete (React/TS/Tailwind setup)
- ‚úÖ Core page structure and navigation built
- ‚úÖ Professional design with modern aesthetics
- üîÑ PRD development in progress
- ‚è≥ G Suite integrations pending (calendar + forms)
- ‚è≥ Content strategy and messaging pending

## Important Guidelines
- Do NOT reference existing rebootmedia.net content (fresh approach required)
- Professional company positioning (NOT sole proprietor)
- Follow PRD for Asian market positioning and messaging

## Technical Patterns

### Form System Architecture
- **3-Step Qualification**: Psychology questions ‚Üí Revenue stage ‚Üí Business details
- **Validation**: Real-time with visual feedback, progressive disclosure
- **Current State**: Logs to console only - NO email integration yet
- **Debug Protocol**: Apply SCOPE ISOLATION GATE from org CLAUDE.md for form issues

### Psychology-Driven UX
- **Typewriter Effect**: Loss aversion headlines with progressive slowdown
- **Social Proof**: Specific numbers ($3M+, 20+ companies, $2B+ managed)
- **Risk Reversal**: "Every month you wait costs $47,000" positioning

### Technical Implementation
- **Responsive**: Swiper.js for mobile pricing, fluid typography with clamp()
- **Performance**: Code splitting, ~65KB gzipped bundle
- **SEO Ready**: Structured data, meta tags, canonical URLs implemented
- **Logo**: Text-based "REBOOT MEDIA" with orange accent (no image logo)

## Inherited Protocol References (from org CLAUDE.md)
- **Time Limits**: 15 min ‚Üí try different, 3 attempts ‚Üí abandon, 60 min ‚Üí strategic rollback
- **File Search**: Working dir ‚Üí project root ‚Üí `/home/ian/user-input/` ‚Üí `/home/ian/` ‚Üí then ask
- **Questions**: Never ask "how" - use tools to discover technical details
- **Scope Gate**: Single issue ‚Üí local fix, Multiple issues ‚Üí WIDE search
