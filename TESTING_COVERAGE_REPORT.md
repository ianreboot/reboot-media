## 🏗️ Testing Architecture Implemented

### **1. Unit Testing Foundation**
```typescript
// Lead scoring with realistic business scenarios
describe('Lead Scoring Algorithm', () => {
  it('should classify ideal leads as hot', () => {
    const result = calculateLeadScore(idealLead);
    expect(result.tier).toBe('hot');
    expect(result.totalScore).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(75);
  });
});

// Marketing attribution with multi-model validation
describe('Marketing Attribution Engine', () => {
  it('should maintain attribution total across all models', () => {
    const comparison = attributionEngine.compareAttributionModels(touchPoints, value);
    Object.values(comparison).forEach(result => {
      expect(result.totalValue).toBe(conversionValue);
    });
  });
});
```

### **2. Integration Testing Framework**
- Enhanced test-utils.tsx with all required providers:
  - ErrorProvider for error handling
  - ABTestProvider for experiment management  
  - ConversionOptimizationProvider for business logic
  - LeadFormProvider for form state management

### **3. Business Logic Validation Patterns**
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Null inputs, boundary values, invalid data
- **Statistical Validation**: Attribution totals, percentage distributions
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Revenue ranges, scoring thresholds
- **Performance Boundaries**: Algorithm execution time limits

## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### **Enhanced Vitest Configuration**
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts enhancements
coverage: {
  provider: 'v8',
  reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html', 'lcov'],
  thresholds: {
    global: { statements: 80, branches: 75, functions: 85, lines: 80 },
    'src/utils/': { statements: 90, branches: 85, functions: 90, lines: 90 },
    'src/contexts/': { statements: 85, branches: 80, functions: 85, lines: 85 }
  }
}
```

### **Test Environment Setup**
```typescript
// Enhanced test-utils.tsx with all providers
const TestProviders = ({ children }) => (
  <ErrorProvider enableErrorReporting={false}>
    <ABTestProvider>
      <ConversionOptimizationProvider>
        <BrowserRouter>
          <LeadFormProvider>
            <ErrorBoundary level="page" name="TestBoundary">
              {children}
            </ErrorBoundary>
          </LeadFormProvider>
        </BrowserRouter>
      </ConversionOptimizationProvider>
    </ABTestProvider>
  </ErrorProvider>
);
```
