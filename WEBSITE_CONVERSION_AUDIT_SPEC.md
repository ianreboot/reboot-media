# Website Conversion Audit Specification

## OVERVIEW
**Goal**: Embody 5 high-value potential clients to identify critical conversion failures and create implementation plan to fix homepage and sub-page architecture
**Success Criteria**: Detailed audit report with specific fixes that increase lead form submission rates
**Estimated Sessions**: 2-3 sessions

## CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE

### Current Website Structure - 2025-08-08
**Homepage**: App.tsx - Single page with typewriter effect, minimal proof points
**Navigation**: Only 3 links in footer to sub-structures (easy to miss)
**Sub-structures**: 
- Growth Plateau Solutions: 8 pages (main + 7 sub-pages)
- Fractional CMO Guide: 8 pages (main + 7 sub-pages) 
- Marketing Psychology: 5 awareness stage pages
**Problem**: No clear path from homepage to valuable content, insufficient proof

### Discovery: Major Conversion Blockers - 2025-08-08
**Problem**: Personas 1-3 revealed critical conversion failures
**Findings**: 
1. **Homepage Proof Gap**: Claims like "30X Growth" with zero evidence/case studies
2. **Navigation Black Hole**: Great content hidden in footer links, no clear path back to convert
3. **Industry Disconnect**: All content is generic, no industry-specific examples
4. **Authority Claims Without Backing**: "Fortune 500", "20+ years", "battle-tested" but no specifics
5. **Journey Dead Ends**: Sub-pages don't funnel back to homepage conversion

**Impact**: Personas interested but can't find proof or clear next steps
**Insight**: Need proof BEFORE asking for lead info, not after

### Discovery: Credibility Crisis - 2025-08-08
**Problem**: Personas 4-5 revealed complete credibility failure
**Findings**:
1. **Amateur Appearance**: Zero case studies while competitors have 5+ detailed ones
2. **Process Opacity**: "Show Me What's Broken" sounds like sales trap, not consultation
3. **Risk Aversion**: No guarantee/trial/risk reversal when asking for personal info
4. **Cultural Blindness**: No Asian market competency signals despite Bangkok base
5. **Authority Hollow**: Claims without supporting evidence make company look fake

**Impact**: Ready-to-buy personas choose competitors due to trust deficit
**Critical**: This is not a design problem - it's a credibility problem
