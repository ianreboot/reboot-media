## Executive Summary

The Reboot Media codebase is a React/TypeScript marketing website built by general AI that requires professional up-leveling to production standards. The current codebase demonstrates solid foundations but has critical gaps in testing infrastructure (38 failing tests including GlobalHeader, PricingCards, LeadForm components), production monitoring, security hardening (development JWT secrets), and data strategy (email-only lead storage). 

This mission will systematically remediate all identified issues using specialized agents working in parallel to achieve maximum efficiency with 62.5% time reduction. The goal is to transform this from a functional prototype into an enterprise-grade production system capable of handling 500+ leads/day with 99.9% uptime, 3-5% conversion rates, and comprehensive observability.

## Methodology

Following LONG_RUNNING_TASK_METHODOLOGY with mandatory Fresh AI validation, context refresh every 1-2 tasks, zero bug tolerance protocol, and sequential execution with parallel agent coordination phases.

## üìù Document Update Instructions (EXECUTE DURING CONTEXT REFRESH)

### When you reach a üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task, complete these steps:

**Note**: Even if there's "nothing to update" (no tasks completed), still READ the document to refresh your context. The reading IS the value.

**ESSENTIAL UPDATES (Do these first):**
1. **Update Task Checklist**:
   - Find the task you just completed in the checklist
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add `(COMPLETED: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
   - If you encountered issues, add a note under the task

2. **Update Current State Variables**:
   - Go to "Current State Variables" section
   - Update `CURRENT_PHASE` to reflect where you are
   - Set boolean flags based on what's been completed
   - Update file locations if you created new files

3. **Update Progress Log**:
   - Go to "Progress Log" section
   - Add new entry with current date/time
   - Document: What was done, files modified, results, issues, next step

4. **Update Quick Stats** (at top of document):
   - Count completed vs total tasks for percentage
   - Update "Current Phase" 
   - Update "Last Update" with current timestamp
   - Note any new blockers

5. **Document Any Discoveries**:
   - If you found something unexpected, add to "Notes & Observations"
   - If you hit an error, add to "Error Recovery & Troubleshooting"
   - If you had to work around something, add to "Workarounds & Hacks"

**ALSO COMPLETE (Additional tasks):**

6. **Re-evaluate Context Refresh Positioning**:
   - Scan entire task checklist for refresh frequency gaps
   - Ensure no more than 1-2 tasks between any refresh points
   - If new tasks were added, insert additional refreshes as needed

7. **Capture Results Immediately**:
   - Document actual outputs, not theoretical expectations
   - Update status markers immediately upon task completion
   - Preserve completed work as navigation context

### Status Markers to Use
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fully implemented and tested
- üîß **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed due to issue
- ‚è≥ **PENDING** - Not yet started
- üß™ **TESTING** - Implementation done, testing in progress

### Critical Rules
1. **Never delete completed tasks** - Future AIs need the history
2. **Always use actual results** - Not theoretical or expected
3. **Include full paths** - Not relative paths
4. **Add timestamps** - For all completions and updates
5. **If contradicting earlier findings** - Mark old as SUPERSEDED

## üö® MANDATORY: Zero Bug Tolerance Protocol

**CRITICAL - When You Discover ANY Bug (Blocking OR Non-Blocking)**:
1. **IMMEDIATELY add the bug fix as a NEW task** to the checklist (even if starting it right away)
2. **Position appropriately**: End of current phase for non-blocking, immediately after current task for blocking
3. **Add a CONTEXT REFRESH task right after the bug fix** (you never know when auto-compaction will hit)
4. **Re-evaluate ALL subsequent refresh positioning** to maintain 1-2 task maximum gaps
5. **Document the discovery** in the appropriate section
6. **NEVER continue with known bugs unaddressed**

### Bug Task Formatting:
```markdown
- [ ] X.Ya FIX: [Specific bug description with file:line reference]
- [ ] üß† CONTEXT REFRESH: Read /home/ian/projects/reboot/CODEBASE_REMEDIATION_MISSION.md and execute "üìù Document Update Instructions"
- [ ] X.Yb Continue [original task name] after bug fix
```

## ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS WORK PROTOCOL

### Core Principle: **Flow Over Permission**
Work continuously with status broadcasting. Only stop for genuine blocks requiring user input.

### Status Broadcasting Format (Continue Working After)
```markdown
üîÑ **STATUS UPDATE** [Timestamp]
üìã Task: [Current task description] 
‚úÖ Progress: X/Y tasks completed (XX%)
üéØ Phase: [Current phase name]
‚ö° Action: [What I'm doing next]
üêõ Issues: [Any problems found - will be added to task list]

[Continue with next task immediately - no wait for user response]
```

### When to CONTINUE Autonomously ‚úÖ
- Running tests, builds, linting, security scans
- Creating/updating files following established patterns  
- Bug fixes that don't change core requirements
- Documentation updates and status tracking
- Agent coordination and result consolidation
- Implementing planned remediation from task list
- Git operations and deployment scripts
- Performance optimization following established metrics

### When to STOP and Wait for User Input ‚ùå
- **Architecture decisions**: Major structural changes beyond remediation scope
- **External dependencies**: Need credentials, access, or external integrations
- **Scope expansion**: Discovered work significantly exceeds remediation scope
- **User preference decisions**: Multiple valid approaches with business implications

## Implementation Details

### Critical Context
**EVERYTHING a fresh AI needs to know to continue the task**

**Project Structure**:
- **Frontend**: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/` - React/TypeScript application
- **Backend**: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/server/` - Express/Node.js (MOCKUP - no real backend functionality)
- **Build Output**: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/dist/` - Production build artifacts
- **Scripts**: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/scripts/` - Deployment and utility scripts
- **Assets**: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/assets/` - Static marketing assets

**Current Issues Identified**:
- 38+ failing tests blocking quality gates
- Development JWT secrets in production code (security vulnerability)
- Email-only lead storage (no database integration)
- Missing error boundaries (UI crashes on JavaScript errors)
- No production monitoring or health checks
- Limited analytics/conversion tracking
- Performance optimizations needed for Core Web Vitals

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Build**: Vite with custom chunk optimization
- **Deployment**: Custom shell scripts, Nginx configuration
- **Monitoring**: Basic Core Web Vitals tracking implemented

**Things That Must Not Change**:
- Core business messaging and conversion flow
- Existing component API contracts
- SEO optimization and structured data
- Performance monitoring infrastructure (enhance, don't replace)
- Security headers and CORS configuration (enhance, don't replace)

### SUCCESS CRITERIA WITH COMPLETION GATES

**MANDATORY**: Define specific, measurable criteria that prevent premature completion

**COMPLETION GATE ENFORCEMENT**:
```markdown
**COMPLETION GATE:**
Mission marked complete ONLY when ALL criteria verified:
‚úÖ Test suite passes with 0 failures and 80%+ meaningful coverage
‚úÖ Security scan shows 0 high/critical vulnerabilities  
‚úÖ Core Web Vitals meet production targets (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, FID <100ms)
‚úÖ Dev environment deployment succeeds with 100% health check pass
‚úÖ Git before/after comparison documented with measurable improvements
‚úÖ All 47 tasks completed with documented proof of implementation
‚úÖ Zero known bugs or production-blocking issues remain
‚úÖ Monitoring systems active with alerting thresholds configured

**DEVIATION = MISSION FAILURE**: Any shortcuts or alternative approaches invalidate results
```

**FORCED ITERATION REQUIREMENT**:
```markdown
**RESTART TRIGGERS** - Return to appropriate checkpoint:
- Test failures remain after remediation ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 3
- Security vulnerabilities unresolved ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 5  
- Performance targets not met ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 6
- Deployment failures ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 9
- Any "close enough" or "mostly working" ‚Üí RESTART until perfect

**ITERATION TRACKING**:
Add to Current State Variables:
ITERATION_COUNT: 0  # Track restart loops
RESTART_REASON: ""  # Document why restarted  
COMPLETION_GATES_PASSED: false  # Only true when ALL gates verified
```

### Agent Coordination Strategy

**Phase 2 Agent Dispatch Protocol**:
All 7 agents will be tasked in parallel to analyze current codebase:

1. **backend-developer** - Server architecture and API quality review
2. **frontend-developer** - React components and performance optimization  
3. **devops-engineer** - Infrastructure, deployment, and monitoring systems
4. **product-engineer** - Business logic alignment and conversion optimization
5. **security-engineer** - Vulnerability assessment and defensive measures
6. **qa-engineer** - Test coverage and quality assurance systems
7. **code-reviewer** - Production readiness and maintainability assessment

**Agent Result Consolidation**:
Each agent will provide:
- Current state assessment with specific issues identified
- Priority recommendations with business impact analysis  
- Implementation roadmap with effort estimates
- Success criteria and validation methods

**Parallel Execution Coordination**:
Phases 3-9 designed for maximum parallel execution where safe:
- Infrastructure fixes (Phase 3) - Independent tasks, parallel safe
- Quality systems (Phase 4) - Different domains, parallel safe
- Security hardening (Phase 5) - Independent security domains, parallel safe
- Performance optimization (Phase 6) - Different performance aspects, parallel safe

### Validation Checklist (Run after major milestones)

```

#### Critical Technical Implementation Details

**Bundle Optimization Implementation (Phase 4.1)**:
```typescript
// /home/ian/projects/reboot/vite.config.ts
rollupOptions: {
  output: {
    manualChunks: (id) => {
      if (id.includes('node_modules')) return 'vendor'
      if (id.includes('/src/pages/')) return 'pages'
      if (id.includes('/src/components/')) return 'components'
      return 'main'
    },
    chunkFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js',
    entryFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js'
  }
}
```

**Database Schema for Lead Storage (Phase 2.4)**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE leads (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  challenge TEXT NOT NULL,
  revenue VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'new',
  gdpr_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  utm_source VARCHAR(100),
  utm_campaign VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Environment Security Setup (Phase 2.2)**:
```bash
# Generate secure JWT secrets
cd /home/ian/projects/reboot
openssl rand -hex 64 > .jwt-access-secret
openssl rand -hex 64 > .jwt-refresh-secret

# Update environment configuration
echo "JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=$(cat .jwt-access-secret)" > .env.production
echo "JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=$(cat .jwt-refresh-secret)" >> .env.production
echo "SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co" >> .env.production
echo "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key" >> .env.production
echo "SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key" >> .env.production
```

**Priority Test Failure Components (Phase 2.1)**:
- GlobalHeader component - likely missing Router context
- PricingCards component - prop type mismatches
- LeadForm component - async rendering issues

#### Final Deployment Validation
```bash
# Build production artifacts
npm run build

# Deploy to dev environment  
./scripts/deploy-dev.sh 2>&1 | tee /home/ian/projects/reboot/deployment-log.log

# Validate deployment health
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || echo "Health check failed"
curl -f http://localhost:3000/ || echo "App unreachable"

# Document final state
git add .
git commit -m "REMEDIATION: Complete up-leveling to production standards - $(date)"
git log --oneline -10 > /home/ian/projects/reboot/git-snapshot-after.log
```

## Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If test failures persist after fixes**:
1. Clear node_modules and package-lock.json
2. Run `npm install` fresh installation
3. Check for TypeScript configuration conflicts
4. Verify test environment setup and mocking

**If security scan shows remaining vulnerabilities**:
1. Run `npm audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Update vulnerable packages to secure versions  
3. Check for custom code security issues
4. Validate environment configuration security

**If performance targets not met**:
1. Analyze bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer
2. Review Core Web Vitals monitoring data
3. Check for performance regression in new code
4. Validate caching and compression settings

**If deployment fails**:
1. Check build artifact integrity
2. Validate server configuration and ports
3. Review deployment script permissions
4. Check environment variable configuration

### Rollback Procedure
If something goes critically wrong:
1. `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to rollback last commit
2. `npm install` to restore clean dependencies
3. `npm run build` to verify clean build state
4. Document issue in Error Recovery section
5. Add bug fix tasks with context refresh

## Test Scenarios & Validation

### Validation Approach
Multi-layered validation approach combining automated testing, security scanning, performance benchmarking, and deployment verification to ensure enterprise-grade quality.
