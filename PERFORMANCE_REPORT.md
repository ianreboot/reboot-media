- Placeholder/skeleton loading states
```

### 📊 Performance Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Main Bundle Size** | 545KB | 74KB | 86% reduction |
| **Initial JavaScript Load** | 545KB | 74KB + 396KB React (lazy) | Better perceived performance |
| **Gzipped CSS** | ~25KB | 20.7KB | 17% reduction |
| **Asset Count** | 578 files | 15 core files | 97% reduction |

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

#### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: Service Worker (instant access)
- **L2 Cache**: Browser cache with proper headers  
- **L3 Cache**: CDN-level caching (when deployed)

#### Loading Strategy
1. **Critical Path**: Essential UI components (74KB)
2. **Route-based**: Page-specific chunks loaded on demand
3. **Vendor Separation**: React/libraries cached separately
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features load progressively

#### Monitoring Strategy
