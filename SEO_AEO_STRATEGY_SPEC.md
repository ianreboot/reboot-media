## CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE

### Problem-Aware Research Discovery - 2025-08-07

**Problem**: Need to understand decision criteria and evaluation process for businesses comparing fractional CMO services
**Research Findings**:
- **Primary decision criteria**: Cost ($5K-$15K/month vs $250K+ full-time), flexibility (scale up/down), strategic focus vs execution

- **Comparison searches**: "fractional CMO vs marketing agency", "fractional CMO vs full-time CMO", "fractional CMO evaluation criteria"
