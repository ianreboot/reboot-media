**Last Completed**: None yet

## Executive Summary

**Mission Objective**: Transform the Reboot Media codebase from AI-generated demo quality to professional production standards through systematic remediation of critical infrastructure, security, performance, and quality issues.

**Critical Context**: Multi-agent assessment revealed the codebase has solid architectural foundations but critical production blockers:
- 578 JavaScript asset files causing severe performance degradation
- Email service stubbed (leads only logged to console)
- 54% test failure rate indicating fundamental instability
- Default JWT secrets exposing complete authentication bypass
- Zero analytics/business intelligence capabilities
- No database persistence (all data lost on restart)

**Business Impact**: Current state prevents production deployment and risks lost revenue from non-functional lead capture system.

## Methodology
Following LONG_RUNNING_TASK_METHODOLOGY.md for crash-resistant execution with:
- Sequential task design with context refresh points every 1-2 tasks
- Single document knowledge preservation
- Zero bug tolerance protocol
- Completion gates preventing premature success
- Parallel agent coordination for maximum efficiency

## üìù Document Update Instructions (EXECUTE DURING CONTEXT REFRESH)

### When you reach a üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task, complete these steps:

**Note**: Even if there's "nothing to update" (no tasks completed), still READ the document to refresh your context. The reading IS the value.

**ESSENTIAL UPDATES (Do these first):**
1. **Update Task Checklist**:
   - Find the task you just completed in the checklist
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add `(COMPLETED: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
   - If you encountered issues, add a note under the task

2. **Update Current State Variables**:
   - Go to "Current State Variables" section
   - Update `CURRENT_PHASE` to reflect where you are
   - Set boolean flags based on what's been completed
   - Update file locations if you created new files

3. **Update Progress Log**:
   - Go to "Progress Log" section
   - Add new entry with current date/time
   - Document: What was done, files modified, results, issues, next step

4. **Update Quick Stats** (at top of document):
   - Count completed vs total tasks for percentage
   - Update "Current Phase" 
   - Update "Last Update" with current timestamp
   - Note any new blockers

5. **Document Any Discoveries**:
   - If you found something unexpected, add to "Notes & Observations"
   - If you hit an error, add to "Error Recovery & Troubleshooting"
   - If you had to work around something, add to "Workarounds & Hacks"

**ALSO COMPLETE (Additional tasks):**

6. **Re-evaluate Context Refresh Positioning**:
   - Scan entire task checklist for refresh frequency gaps
   - Ensure no more than 1-2 tasks between any refresh points
   - If new tasks were added, insert additional refreshes as needed

7. **Capture Results Immediately**:
   - Document actual outputs, not theoretical expectations
   - Update status markers immediately upon task completion
   - Preserve completed work as navigation context

### Status Markers to Use
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Fully implemented and tested
- üîß **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed due to issue
- ‚è≥ **PENDING** - Not yet started
- üß™ **TESTING** - Implementation done, testing in progress

### Critical Rules
1. **Never delete completed tasks** - Future AIs need the history
2. **Always use actual results** - Not theoretical or expected
3. **Include full paths** - Not relative paths
4. **Add timestamps** - For all completions and updates
5. **If contradicting earlier findings** - Mark old as SUPERSEDED

## Implementation Details

### Critical Context
**EVERYTHING a fresh AI needs to know to continue the task**

**Key Information**:
- Project Location: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/`
- Current deployment: `npm run deploy:dev` ‚Üí `https://dev.rebootmedia.net/reboot/`
- Lead form currently stubs email sending (only console.log)
- 578 JavaScript files in assets/ directory causing performance crisis
- Server runs on port 3002, client on 5173 in development
- Git repository has modified .claude.json file ready for commit

**Things That Must Not Change**:
- Existing component structure and React Router configuration
- Current API endpoint paths (/api/forms/lead, /api/health)
- Development vs production base path configuration (/reboot/ vs /)
- Authentication system architecture (JWT with refresh tokens)
- Security middleware stack (rate limiting, CORS, helmet)

**SUCCESS CRITERIA WITH COMPLETION GATES**:
**MANDATORY**: Define specific, measurable criteria that prevent premature completion

**COMPLETION GATE ENFORCEMENT**:
```markdown
**COMPLETION GATE:**
Mission marked complete ONLY when ALL criteria verified:
‚úÖ Bundle size reduced from 578 files to maximum 5 semantic chunks with <150KB total
   VERIFY: ls dist/assets/*.js | wc -l  # Must show ‚â§5
   VERIFY: du -sh dist/assets/*.js | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'  # Must be <150KB
‚úÖ Test pass rate improved from 46% to minimum 90% (no critical component failures)
   VERIFY: npm run test 2>&1 | grep "Tests:" # Must show ‚â•90% passing
‚úÖ Lead form successfully saves to Supabase database with email notifications working
   VERIFY: Submit test lead, then check Supabase dashboard for new record
   VERIFY: Check email inbox for notification message
‚úÖ All 8 critical/high-risk security vulnerabilities patched with documented verification
   VERIFY: npm audit --audit-level=high  # Must show 0 vulnerabilities
‚úÖ Google Analytics implemented with conversion tracking active and tested
   VERIFY: Check GA4 Real-time dashboard while submitting test lead
‚úÖ Application deploys successfully to dev environment and functions correctly
   VERIFY: curl https://dev.rebootmedia.net/reboot/ | grep -q "Reboot Media"
‚úÖ Git repository clean with all changes committed and pushed
   VERIFY: git status  # Must show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
‚úÖ Zero known bugs or console errors in production build
   VERIFY: Open browser console at production URL, check for red errors

**DEVIATION = MISSION FAILURE**: Any shortcuts or alternative approaches invalidate results
```

**FORCED ITERATION REQUIREMENT**:
```markdown
**RESTART TRIGGERS** - Return to appropriate checkpoint:
- Bundle still fragmented into >5 files ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 2
- Test failures remain above 10% ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 3  
- Security vulnerabilities unpatched ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 4
- Analytics not tracking conversions ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 5
- Deployment fails or shows errors ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 6
- Any "close enough" or "mostly working" ‚Üí RESTART until perfect

**ITERATION TRACKING**:
*Already included in Current State Variables section*

### Detailed Implementation Guide

#### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure Foundation

1. **Supabase Setup**
   - Action: Create new Supabase project at https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Database Schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE leads (
       id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       challenge TEXT NOT NULL,
       revenue VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
       status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'new'
     );
     ```
   - Environment Variables:
     ```env
     SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
     ```
   - Expected Result: Database ready to receive lead form data
   - Verification: Test insert/select operations work correctly

2. **Environment Security**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/.env.example`
   - Action: Create template with secure defaults
   - Generate JWT Secrets:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32  # JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
     openssl rand -hex 32  # JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
     openssl rand -hex 32  # JWT_EMAIL_SECRET
     openssl rand -hex 32  # JWT_PASSWORD_RESET_SECRET
     ```
   - Expected Result: Secure secrets replace default placeholders
   - Verification: No hardcoded secrets remain in codebase

3. **Database Integration**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/server/src/utils/leadService.ts`
   - Action: Replace email stub with Supabase client
   - Implementation:
     ```typescript
     import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
     
     export async function saveLead(leadData: LeadData): Promise<boolean> {
       const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY)
       const { error } = await supabase.from('leads').insert([leadData])
       return !error
     }
     ```
   - Expected Result: Lead form data persists to database
   - Verification: Form submission creates database record

4. **Email Service Configuration**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/server/src/utils/emailService.ts`
   - Action: Implement SendGrid or Mailgun integration
   - Expected Result: Actual emails sent on form submission
   - Verification: Test email received at business address

#### Phase 2: Performance & Build Optimization

1. **Bundle Fragmentation Fix**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/vite.config.ts`
   - Problem: 578 separate JS files causing hundreds of HTTP requests
   - Analysis Commands:
     ```bash
     # Current state analysis
     npm run build:prod
     ls -la dist/assets/*.js | wc -l  # Count current JS files
     du -sh dist/assets/  # Check total size
     ```
   - Solution:
     ```typescript
     rollupOptions: {
       output: {
         manualChunks: (id) => {
           if (id.includes('node_modules')) return 'vendor'
           if (id.includes('/src/pages/')) return 'pages'
           if (id.includes('/src/components/')) return 'components'
           return 'main'
         },
         chunkFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js',
         entryFileNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash].js'
       }
     }
     ```
   - Expected Result: Maximum 5 JavaScript files in assets/
   - Verification Commands:
     ```bash
     npm run build:prod
     ls dist/assets/*.js  # Should list ‚â§5 files
     ls dist/assets/*.js | wc -l  # Should output ‚â§5
     du -sh dist/assets/*.js  # Each file size
     ```

2. **Build Memory Optimization**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/package.json`
   - Current Issue Check:
     ```bash
     grep -n "max-old-space-size" package.json  # Find memory patches
     ```
   - Action: Remove memory patches from build scripts
   - Expected Result: Build completes without memory allocation workarounds
   - Verification: `npm run build:prod` succeeds with default memory

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Testing

1. **Test Failure Resolution**
   - Files: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/components/__tests__/*.test.tsx`
   - Problem: 36 failing tests (54% failure rate)
   - Analysis Commands:
     ```bash
     # Get current test status
     npm run test -- --no-coverage 2>&1 | grep -E "(Tests:|FAIL|PASS)"
     # Run specific failing component tests
     npm run test -- GlobalHeader --no-coverage
     npm run test -- PricingCards --no-coverage
     npm run test -- LeadForm --no-coverage
     ```
   - Priority: GlobalHeader, PricingCards, LeadForm components
   - Common fixes:
     - Missing mock providers (Router, Theme)
     - Prop type mismatches
     - Async rendering issues
   - Expected Result: >90% test pass rate
   - Verification:
     ```bash
     npm run test -- --watchAll=false 2>&1 | grep "Tests:"
     # Should show something like: Tests: 162 passed, 162 total
     ```

2. **Backend Test Suite**
   - Files: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/server/src/__tests__/`
   - Problem: 0% backend test coverage
   - Check current coverage:
     ```bash
     npm run test:server -- --coverage 2>/dev/null || echo "No server tests found"
     ```
   - Implementation: API endpoint tests, middleware tests, validation tests
   - Test file structure:
     ```
     server/src/__tests__/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.test.ts
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ forms.test.ts
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/
     ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security.test.ts
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validation.test.ts
     ```
   - Expected Result: >75% backend code coverage
   - Verification: Test suite covers all critical server functionality

## Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If Bundle optimization fails**:
1. Check vite.config.ts syntax for rollupOptions
2. Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
3. Verify import statements don't create circular dependencies
4. Test build with NODE_ENV=production

**If Supabase connection fails**:
1. Verify environment variables are correctly set
2. Check Supabase project status and API keys
3. Test connection with curl commands
4. Verify network access and firewall settings

**If Tests continue failing**:
1. Run tests individually to isolate issues
2. Check for component prop type mismatches
3. Verify test environment configuration
4. Clear test cache: `npm run test -- --clearCache`

**If Email service fails**:
1. Verify API keys and service configuration
2. Check email service status and limits
3. Test with simple API call outside application
4. Verify DNS and network connectivity

### Rollback Procedure
If something goes critically wrong:
1. `git stash` any uncommitted changes
2. `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to previous commit
3. Document what failed in "Notes & Observations"
4. Add bug fix task to checklist before retrying

## Test Scenarios & Validation

### Validation Approach
**Mission success validated through systematic verification**:
1. **Performance Testing**: Bundle analysis and load time measurement
2. **Functional Testing**: End-to-end lead form submission workflow
3. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scan and penetration testing

### Baseline Metrics
**Pre-Remediation State (2025-01-13)**:
- Bundle Size: 210KB total, 578 separate JS files
- Test Pass Rate: 46% (126 passing, 36 failing)
- Security Issues: 8 critical/high-risk vulnerabilities
- Database Persistence: None (email stub only)
- Analytics: Zero tracking or measurement
- Deployment Status: Dev environment functional, prod not ready

### Current/Optimized Metrics  
**Post-Remediation Target**:
- Bundle Size: <150KB total, maximum 5 JS files
- Test Pass Rate: >90% (all critical components passing)
- Security Issues: Zero critical/high-risk vulnerabilities
- Database Persistence: Full Supabase integration with email notifications
- Analytics: GA4 with conversion tracking and business metrics
- Deployment Status: Production-ready with automated CI/CD

### Comparison Analysis
[Will be populated during execution with specific before/after measurements]

### Workarounds & Hacks (Document what you had to do)
```bash
# HACK: Memory allocation for large builds
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build:prod

# WHY: Vite runs out of memory with 578 fragmented files
# TODO: Fix bundle fragmentation in vite.config.ts

# HACK: Clear test cache when tests behave strangely
npm run test -- --clearCache

# WHY: Jest sometimes caches broken module resolutions
# TODO: Configure Jest to handle module resolution properly

# HACK: Kill orphaned dev servers
lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# WHY: Dev servers sometimes don't clean up properly
# TODO: Implement proper graceful shutdown in server code
```

## Notes & Observations

### Hard-Fought Knowledge
[Critical discoveries that future AIs must know]

#### Agent Assessment Summary - 2025-01-13
**Problem**: Codebase generated by AI needs professional quality uplift
**Analysis**: Multi-agent review revealed solid architecture with critical execution gaps
**Key Insights**: 
- Security architecture excellent but implementation uses defaults/stubs
- Performance monitoring sophisticated but bundle output severely fragmented
- Business logic well-designed but missing analytics and persistence
- Test structure present but 54% failure rate indicates fundamental issues
**Impact**: Mission designed for systematic parallel agent remediation

### Patterns Discovered
- Bundle fragmentation appears to be Vite configuration issue, not architecture problem
- Test failures concentrated in UI components, suggesting rendering/props issues
- Security vulnerabilities mostly configuration-based, not architectural flaws
- Email service architecture ready, just needs service provider integration
