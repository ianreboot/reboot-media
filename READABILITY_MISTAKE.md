## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue appears to be:
1. **Insufficient color contrast ratio** between text and background elements
2. **Complex background layers** (gradients, images, overlays) that interfere with text readability
3. **Missing text shadows or background overlays** that would improve contrast
4. **Inconsistent text styling** across different content sections

## Required Fixes
Each page needs:
1. **Contrast ratio audit** - Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. **Background overlay adjustments** - Add semi-transparent overlays behind text where needed
3. **Text shadow implementation** - Add subtle text shadows for better separation from backgrounds
4. **Color scheme optimization** - Adjust text colors to ensure maximum readability
5. **Alternative background treatments** - Consider solid color backgrounds for critical text sections

## Testing Requirements
- Test with color contrast analyzers
- Validate across different screen sizes and resolutions  
- Check accessibility compliance with screen readers
- Verify readability in different lighting conditions
