## 📝 Document Update Instructions (EXECUTE DURING CONTEXT REFRESH)

### When you reach a 🧠 CONTEXT REFRESH task, complete these steps:

**Note**: Even if there's "nothing to update" (no tasks completed), still READ the document to refresh your context. The reading IS the value.

**ESSENTIAL UPDATES (Do these first):**
1. **Update Task Checklist**:
   - Find the task you just completed in the checklist
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add `(COMPLETED: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
   - If you encountered issues, add a note under the task

2. **Update Current State Variables**:
   - Go to "Current State Variables" section
   - Update `CURRENT_PHASE` to reflect where you are
   - Set boolean flags based on what's been completed
   - Update file locations if you created new files

3. **Update Progress Log**:
   - Go to "Progress Log" section
   - Add new entry with current date/time
   - Document: What was done, files modified, results, issues, next step

4. **Update Quick Stats** (at top of document):
   - Count completed vs total tasks for percentage
   - Update "Current Phase" 
   - Update "Last Update" with current timestamp
   - Note any new blockers

5. **Document Any Discoveries**:
   - If you found something unexpected, add to "Notes & Observations"
   - If you hit an error, add to "Error Recovery & Troubleshooting"
   - If you had to work around something, add to "Workarounds & Hacks"

**ALSO COMPLETE (Additional tasks):**

6. **Re-evaluate Context Refresh Positioning**:
   - Scan entire task checklist for refresh frequency gaps
   - Ensure no more than 1-2 tasks between any refresh points
   - If new tasks were added, insert additional refreshes as needed

7. **Capture Results Immediately**:
   - Document actual outputs, not theoretical expectations
   - Update status markers immediately upon task completion
   - Preserve completed work as navigation context

### Status Markers to Use
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fully implemented and tested
- 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed due to issue
- ⏳ **PENDING** - Not yet started
- 🧪 **TESTING** - Implementation done, testing in progress

### Critical Rules
1. **Never delete completed tasks** - Future AIs need the history
2. **Always use actual results** - Not theoretical or expected
3. **Include full paths** - Not relative paths
4. **Add timestamps** - For all completions and updates
5. **If contradicting earlier findings** - Mark old as SUPERSEDED

## Task Checklist - PARALLEL AGENT EXECUTION DESIGN (UPDATE AFTER EACH STEP)

### 🎯 PARALLEL AGENT EXECUTION STRATEGY
**Design tasks for parallel agent execution - one agent per project to prevent context bleed:**

**AGENT ASSIGNMENT RULES**:
- **Frontend-Developer Agent**: UI, build systems, bundling, client-side security, performance optimization
- **Backend-Developer Agent**: APIs, databases, server configs, authentication, data processing
- **One agent per project** to prevent context contamination
- **Maximum 4 agents per message** for optimal parallel execution
- **Project-specific focus** - agent works exclusively on assigned project

### Phase 1: Critical Issues Resolution (IMMEDIATE - 24-48 hours)

### 🚨 RESTART PROTOCOL: Zero Issues Enforcement
**MANDATORY RESTART CONDITIONS** (Return to Phase 1, Batch 1.1):
- ANY build errors or warnings found by code-reviewer
- ANY security vulnerabilities (medium/high/critical) found by security-engineer  
- ANY performance targets missed (bundle size, Core Web Vitals)
- ANY test coverage below 80% on critical paths
- ANY "close enough" or "mostly working" solutions
- ANY shortcuts or deviation from exact requirements

**ZERO ISSUES DEFINITION**:
✅ **Build Status**: All projects build with zero errors, zero warnings  
✅ **Security Status**: Zero vulnerabilities of any severity level  
✅ **Performance Status**: All bundles <200KB, all Core Web Vitals green  
✅ **Test Status**: >80% coverage, all tests passing  
✅ **Deployment Status**: All projects deploy successfully to production  
✅ **Quality Status**: Code-reviewer finds zero issues  
✅ **Audit Status**: Security-engineer finds zero concerns

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Zero Bug Tolerance Protocol

**CRITICAL - When You Discover ANY Bug (Blocking OR Non-Blocking)**:
1. **IMMEDIATELY add the bug fix as a NEW task** to the checklist (even if starting it right away)
2. **Position appropriately**: End of current phase for non-blocking, immediately after current task for blocking
3. **Add a CONTEXT REFRESH task right after the bug fix** (you never know when auto-compaction will hit)
4. **Re-evaluate ALL subsequent refresh positioning** to maintain 1-2 task maximum gaps
5. **Document the discovery** in the appropriate section
6. **NEVER continue with known bugs unaddressed**

### Bug Task Formatting:
```markdown
- [ ] X.Ya FIX: [Specific bug description with file:line reference]
- [ ] 🧠 CONTEXT REFRESH: Read /home/ian/projects/reboot/4-PROJECT-REMEDIATION-TASK.md and execute "📝 Document Update Instructions"
- [ ] X.Yb Continue [original task name] after bug fix
```

## 🤖 AUTONOMOUS WORK PROTOCOL

### Core Principle: **Flow Over Permission**
Work continuously with status broadcasting. Only stop for genuine blocks requiring user input.

### Status Broadcasting Format (Continue Working After)
```markdown
🔄 **STATUS UPDATE** [Timestamp]
📋 Task: [Current task description] 
✅ Progress: X/Y tasks completed (XX%)
🎯 Phase: [Current phase name]
⚡ Action: [What I'm doing next]
🐛 Issues: [Any problems found - will be added to task list]

[Continue with next task immediately - no wait for user response]
```

### When to CONTINUE Autonomously ✅
- Running tests, builds, lint fixes across projects
- Installing dependencies, updating packages
- Fixing code quality issues following established patterns
- Security improvements (CSP, headers, validation)
- Documentation updates and progress tracking
- Performance optimizations (code splitting, bundling)
- Implementation following planned task list

### When to STOP and Wait for User Input ❌
- Major architecture decisions affecting multiple projects
- External dependencies requiring credentials or access
- Scope changes significantly exceeding original estimates
- User preference decisions (deployment strategies, etc.)
- Data safety concerns across multiple projects

## Implementation Details

### Critical Context
**EVERYTHING a fresh AI needs to know to continue the task**

**Key Information**:
- 4 React/TypeScript projects requiring comprehensive remediation
- Agent analysis completed - detailed findings documented in main report
- Production readiness varies: final-expense (90%) > home-warranty/reboot (60%) > syncup (40%)
- Security posture generally strong, performance optimization needed
- Build systems have critical failures in home-warranty and syncup

**Project Locations**:
- `/home/ian/projects/home-warranty/` - Lead generation, test failures blocking
- `/home/ian/projects/final-expense/` - Insurance leads, nearly production ready
- `/home/ian/projects/syncup/` - Social app, major build system issues
- `/home/ian/projects/reboot/` - Media site, performance issues (808KB bundle)

**Things That Must Not Change**:
- Core functionality and user experience
- Existing security implementations that are working
- Database schemas (especially syncup)
- Production deployment URLs and configurations

**SUCCESS CRITERIA WITH COMPLETION GATES**:
**MANDATORY**: Define specific, measurable criteria that prevent premature completion

**COMPLETION GATE ENFORCEMENT**:
```markdown
**COMPLETION GATE:**
Mission marked complete ONLY when ALL criteria verified:
✅ All 4 projects build successfully with zero errors
✅ All critical security vulnerabilities resolved (CSP, dependencies)
✅ Test suites restored and passing (>80% coverage on critical paths)
✅ Bundle sizes optimized (<200KB initial load for all projects)
✅ Performance benchmarks meet targets (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1)
✅ All production blockers resolved
✅ Security audit passes with no high/critical findings
✅ All projects successfully deploy to production environment
✅ Quality analysis comparison shows measurable improvements
✅ Zero known bugs or misleading outputs remain

**DEVIATION = MISSION FAILURE**: Any shortcuts or alternative approaches invalidate results
```

**FORCED ITERATION REQUIREMENT**:
```markdown
**RESTART TRIGGERS** - Return to appropriate checkpoint:
- Any project fails production deployment → RESTART at Phase 1
- Security vulnerabilities remain unresolved → RESTART at Phase 2
- Performance targets not met → RESTART at Phase 4
- Test coverage below 80% on critical paths → RESTART at Phase 6
- Any "close enough" or "mostly working" → RESTART until perfect

**ITERATION TRACKING**:
ITERATION_COUNT: 0  # Track restart loops
RESTART_REASON: ""  # Document why restarted  
COMPLETION_GATES_PASSED: false  # Only true when ALL gates verified
```

### Detailed Implementation Guide

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
[Provide enough detail that a fresh AI can execute without prior context]

1. **Fix Home-Warranty Test Suite**
   - File: `/home/ian/projects/home-warranty/src/test/setup.ts`
   - Action: Add `import React from 'react';` at top of file
   - Expected Result: Test suite should run without JSX syntax errors
   - Verification: Run `cd /home/ian/projects/home-warranty && npm test`

2. **Update Dependencies Across All Projects**
   - Command: `cd /home/ian/projects/[project] && npm audit fix --force`
   - Expected Output: Vulnerabilities resolved, packages updated
   - If Error: Document specific failures and alternative solutions

3. **Fix Build System Failures**
   - Syncup: Check `/home/ian/projects/syncup/vite.config.ts` for asset configuration
   - Reboot: Investigate bundle splitting in `/home/ian/projects/reboot/vite.config.ts`
   - Expected Result: Builds complete without asset reference errors

[Continue for all major steps...]

## Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If Test Suite Fails After React Import Fix**:
1. Check TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
2. Verify React types are installed: `npm install --save-dev @types/react`
3. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**If Bundle Size Optimization Fails**:
1. Analyze bundle with `npm run build -- --analyze`
2. Check dynamic imports are properly implemented
3. Verify Vite/Webpack code splitting configuration

**If Security Scans Still Show Vulnerabilities**:
1. Run detailed audit: `npm audit --audit-level high`
2. Check for alternative package versions
3. Document acceptable risks for low-severity issues

### Rollback Procedure
If something goes critically wrong:
1. Git checkout to last known working state: `git checkout [commit-hash]`
2. Document what failed in Progress Log
3. Add rollback reason to Current State Variables
4. Continue with alternative approach or request user guidance

## Test Scenarios & Validation

### Validation Approach
Each project must pass comprehensive validation before marking as complete:
- Build succeeds with zero errors
- All tests pass with >80% coverage on critical components
- Security scan shows zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance metrics meet targets (bundle size, Core Web Vitals)
- Manual testing of core user flows successful

### Execution Plan  
1. **Infrastructure Validation**: All projects build and run locally
2. **Security Validation**: Run npm audit, CSP validation, dependency checks
3. **Performance Validation**: Bundle analysis, Core Web Vitals measurement
4. **Functional Validation**: Manual testing of key user flows
5. **Production Validation**: Deploy and verify in production environment

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Each project builds without errors or warnings
- [ ] Security scans pass across all projects

## Notes & Observations

### Hard-Fought Knowledge
[Critical discoveries that future AIs must know]

#### Agent Analysis Quality - 2025-08-12 15:00
**Problem**: Comprehensive analysis across 8 agent reviews needs consolidation
**Solution**: Single task document with phased approach prevents information loss
**Key Insight**: All projects show similar patterns - strong architecture, tooling issues
**Example**: TypeScript strict mode disabled across multiple projects indicates systematic technical debt

### Patterns Discovered
- All projects use React/TypeScript with modern tooling
- Security implementations are generally strong (final-expense, syncup exemplary)
- Performance issues consistent across projects (bundle size optimization needed)
- Test infrastructure needs systematic restoration
- Build system configurations have critical failures requiring immediate attention
