## Implementation Details

### Critical Context
**Key Information**:
- Most critical issue: Modal/popup has white text on white background (sitewide)
- CSS classes `replace-text-slate-900` and `replace-text-slate-700` are undefined
- Need to follow DRY principles and use Tailwind utilities over custom CSS
- Testing via `npm run dev` and `npm run deploy:dev`
- Dev URL: https://dev.rebootmedia.net/reboot/
- Production URL: https://www.rebootmedia.net/

**Things That Must Not Change**:
- Core functionality of forms and navigation
- Existing working features
- Production deployment process

**Success Criteria**:
- All text is readable with proper contrast
- No overlapping elements
- Consistent design patterns across similar sections
- Forms function properly
- All fixes work across different browsers

### Agent Execution Strategy
- Use frontend-developer agents for implementation
- Group tasks by page to minimize CSS conflicts
- Execute up to 4 agents in parallel per message
- Each agent handles complete fix for their assigned area
- Test after each phase before proceeding

## Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If CSS conflicts occur**:
1. Check for !important declarations
2. Review specificity hierarchy
3. Consolidate to Tailwind utilities
4. Test in isolation first

**If text still unreadable after fix**:
1. Check parent container styles
2. Look for inherited styles
3. Verify no inline styles override
4. Use browser dev tools to debug

### Rollback Procedure
If something goes critically wrong:
1. `git checkout qa-fixes-backup-20250911-005054`
2. Preserve any successful fixes in separate files
3. Report specific failure points

## Notes & Observations

### Hard-Fought Knowledge

#### CSS Class Discovery - 2025-09-11 00:55
**Problem**: Modal text unreadable (white on white)
**Investigation**: Found `replace-text-slate-900` and `replace-text-slate-700` classes in LeadForm.tsx
**Actual Finding**: These classes are not defined in any CSS file
**Solution**: Need to replace with standard Tailwind classes
**Key Insight**: Custom CSS classes without definitions cause text to default to inherit/transparent

### Patterns Discovered
- Multiple pages using undefined `replace-text-*` classes
- Accessibility utilities CSS exists but doesn't define needed classes
- Conflicting CSS has been an issue in past fixes
