## CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE
[This section grows with each discovery]

### Initial Understanding - 2025-08-07
**Current State**: Single page with good foundation but lacks depth and real examples
**User Intent**: Add "meat" that demonstrates expertise - show what customers might never have thought of
**Key Constraint**: Avoid direct geographic references (let viewers infer from context)
**Approach**: Summary + detail pages with real customer language and situations
**Target Audience**: Companies stuck at revenue milestones ($500K, $1M, $1.5M, etc.)
**Link Strategy**: Reference marketing psychology awareness stages where relevant

### Revenue Ceiling Research - 2025-08-07
**Discovery**: Companies stuck at revenue milestones share predictable patterns
**Key Insights**:
1. **$500K-750K Plateau**: Founder can't delegate sales, no documented process
   - Customer says: "I'm still closing every deal personally"
   - Real problem: No sales playbook, can't train others
   - Solution: Document discovery questions, objection handling, pricing conversations
   - Why it works: Makes founder's intuition transferable

2. **$1M-1.5M Plateau**: Marketing generates volume but wrong fit
   - Customer says: "We have leads but they don't convert"
   - Real problem: Broad targeting attracts unqualified prospects
   - Solution: Narrow ICP, qualify harder upfront, say no more
   - Why it works: Better to have 10 perfect fits than 100 poor fits

3. **$1.5M-2M Plateau**: Pricing model prevents scaling
   - Customer says: "We win deals but margins are shrinking"
   - Real problem: Customization and discounting erode unit economics
   - Solution: Standardize offerings, value-based pricing, remove negotiation
   - Why it works: Predictable revenue requires predictable pricing

4. **$2M-3M Plateau**: Operations can't support growth
   - Customer says: "Every new customer makes things harder"
   - Real problem: Manual processes that worked at $500K break at $2M
   - Solution: Automate onboarding, standardize delivery, measure everything
   - Why it works: Scale requires systems, not heroes

5. **$3M-5M Plateau**: Market positioning too narrow
   - Customer says: "Our TAM feels exhausted"
   - Real problem: Defined market too specifically, missing adjacent opportunities
   - Solution: Expand use cases, not features
   - Why it works: Same product, new problems to solve

**Common Psychology Mistakes**:
- Talking about company growth instead of customer outcomes
- Using same message for different revenue stages
- Founder's expertise creating "curse of knowledge" in messaging
- Social proof from wrong-sized companies (showing Fortune 500 logos to SMBs)

### Customer Acquisition Plateau Research - 2025-08-07
**Discovery**: CAC inflation patterns follow predictable stages
**Key Patterns**:

1. **"More Leads" Trap**: Higher volume, worse quality
   - Customer says: "Our CAC keeps rising but MQLs are flat"
   - Real problem: Broad targeting to hit lead volume goals
   - Solution: Narrow ICP, qualify harder before handoff
   - Why it works: Better to pay $200 for qualified lead than $50 for junk

2. **"Best Practice" Copying**: Following competitors blindly
   - Customer says: "We're doing everything competitors do"
   - Real problem: Same channels, same message, same prospects
   - Solution: Find overlooked channels where ICP hangs out
   - Why it works: Blue ocean in channel strategy, not product

3. **"Features War" Messaging**: Product-focused copy everywhere
   - Customer says: "Our product is clearly superior"
   - Real problem: Prospects don't care about features, care about outcomes
   - Solution: Outcome-focused messaging by awareness stage
   - Why it works: People buy results, not features

4. **"Spray and Pray" Approach**: No systematic testing
   - Customer says: "We try different things but nothing sticks"
   - Real problem: Random testing without hypothesis or measurement
   - Solution: Scientific approach - hypothesis, test, measure, scale
   - Why it works: Compound improvement beats random changes

5. **"Vanity Metrics" Focus**: Optimizing wrong numbers
   - Customer says: "Our website traffic is growing nicely"
   - Real problem: Traffic doesn't equal revenue
   - Solution: Focus on revenue-driving metrics only
   - Why it works: Revenue per visitor > total visitors

6. **"One-Size-Fits-All" Funnel**: Same experience for all stages
   - Customer says: "Our conversion rate is stuck"
   - Real problem: Unaware prospects get "buy now" messaging
   - Solution: Different funnels for different awareness stages
   - Why it works: Right message, right stage, right time

7. **"Discount Dependency"**: Competing on price only
   - Customer says: "We have to discount to close deals"
   - Real problem: Value proposition isn't compelling enough
   - Solution: Reframe around ROI and risk reduction
   - Why it works: Value > Price when communicated properly
