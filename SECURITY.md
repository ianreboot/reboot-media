# Security Configuration for Reboot Media Website

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers configured in HTML files and server configs
- Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- Allows only trusted sources (self, Google Fonts)

### 2. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block (enables browser XSS protection)
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **Permissions-Policy**: Denies camera, microphone, geolocation access

### 3. Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- HTML tags stripped from text inputs
- Special characters escaped to prevent XSS
- URL validation for website inputs
- Email validation and sanitization

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Form submissions limited to 5 attempts per minute
- Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- Implemented in both client and server configurations

### 5. Development Security
- Console logs only in development mode
- No sensitive data exposed in production
- Source maps disabled in production builds

### 6. Server Configuration
- `.htaccess` file for Apache servers
- `nginx-security.conf` for Nginx servers
- HTTPS enforcement
- Directory listing disabled
- Access to sensitive files blocked

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure all console.logs are wrapped in DEV checks
- [ ] Verify CSP headers in HTML files
- [ ] Check that source maps are disabled for production

### Server Configuration:
- [ ] Apply appropriate security headers (Apache/.htaccess or Nginx config)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS and force SSL redirect
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Hide server version information
- [ ] Block access to sensitive files (.env, .git, etc.)

### Post-Deployment:
- [ ] Test CSP headers using browser developer tools
- [ ] Verify security headers using online tools (e.g., securityheaders.com)
- [ ] Test form rate limiting
- [ ] Check for any console errors or exposed data

## Remaining Server-Side Considerations

The following security measures require server-side implementation:

1. **Email API Security**
   - Implement server-side email sending (never expose SMTP credentials)
   - Add CAPTCHA or similar bot protection
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs server-side

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Configure appropriate CORS headers if adding API endpoints
   - Restrict origins to trusted domains only

3. **Session Security**
   - If adding authentication, use secure session management
   - Implement CSRF protection for forms

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up security monitoring and alerting
   - Log suspicious activities
   - Regular security audits
