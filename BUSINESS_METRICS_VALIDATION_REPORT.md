## Conversion Rate Optimization Breakdown

### How We Achieve 3.70% Conversion Rate

The projected 3.70% conversion rate is achieved through compounding improvements:

```
Base Conversion Rate: 2.30%
√ó A/B Testing Optimization: 1.15 (15% lift)
√ó Exit Intent Recovery: 1.10 (10% lift)
√ó Form Optimization: 1.12 (12% lift)
√ó Mobile Optimization: 1.08 (8% lift)
√ó Lead Scoring Focus: 1.05 (5% lift)
= Projected Rate: 3.70%
```
