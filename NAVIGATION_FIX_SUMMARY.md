# Navigation Fix Summary - Reboot Media

## Issue Identified
Internal links weren't working correctly on dev.rebootmedia.net because of hardcoded path checks that didn't account for the React Router basename properly.

## Root Cause
The code was checking `window.location.pathname` directly against hardcoded values like `'/'` and `'/reboot/'` instead of using React Router's location hooks which automatically handle the basename.

## Files Fixed

### 1. GlobalHeader.tsx
**Before**: `if (window.location.pathname === '/' || window.location.pathname === '/reboot/')`
**After**: `if (location.pathname === '/')`
- Now uses `useLocation` hook from React Router
- Properly handles basename automatically

### 2. GlobalFooter.tsx  
**Before**: `if (window.location.pathname !== '/' && window.location.pathname !== '/reboot/')`
**After**: `if (location.pathname !== '/')`
- Now uses `useLocation` hook from React Router
- Consistent with GlobalHeader implementation

### 3. navigation.ts
- Marked `navigateToHash` function as deprecated
- Added warning to use React Router navigation instead

## Key Learnings

### DO ✅
- Use `useLocation()` hook from React Router for path checking
- Use `<Link to="/path">` for all internal navigation
- Let React Router handle basename automatically
- Use relative paths in Link components (starting with `/`)

### DON'T ❌
- Don't use `window.location.pathname` for path checking
- Don't hardcode `/reboot/` paths in conditional logic
- Don't use `window.location.href` for internal navigation
- Don't mix React Router with direct DOM navigation

## How It Works Now

1. **Router Configuration** (Router.tsx):
   - Sets `basename="/reboot"` for dev builds
   - Sets `basename=""` for prod builds
   - Based on `import.meta.env.MODE`

2. **Build Process**:
   - `npm run build:dev` → Uses `--mode development` → basename = "/reboot"
   - `npm run build:prod` → Uses `--mode production` → basename = ""

3. **Link Components**:
   - All use paths like `/growth-plateau-solutions/...`
   - React Router automatically prepends basename
   - Dev: becomes `/reboot/growth-plateau-solutions/...`
   - Prod: stays `/growth-plateau-solutions/...`

4. **Location Checking**:
   - Uses `useLocation()` hook which returns paths relative to basename
   - `location.pathname === '/'` works for both dev and prod
   - No need to check for `/reboot/` explicitly

## Testing Verification

✅ All internal links now work correctly on https://dev.rebootmedia.net/reboot/
✅ Navigation between pages maintains SPA behavior (no full page reloads)
✅ Hash navigation to homepage sections works from any page
✅ Build process correctly sets basename for each environment
