# Server-Side Security Requirements

## Issues That Require Server Configuration

### 1. HTTP Security Headers
While we've added security headers to the HTML files via meta tags, the most effective implementation requires server configuration:

- **Apache**: Use the provided `.htaccess` file in the public directory
- **Nginx**: Apply the configurations from `nginx-security.conf`
- **Other servers**: Configure equivalent headers

### 2. HTTPS Enforcement
- Must be configured at the server/hosting level
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- Use HSTS header for strict transport security

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Client-side rate limiting (implemented in `sanitization.ts`) can be bypassed
- Server-side rate limiting is required for proper protection
- Configure at reverse proxy or application server level

### 4. Email API Security
- Never expose email credentials client-side
- Implement server-side email sending endpoint
- Add CAPTCHA or similar bot protection
- Validate all inputs server-side

### 5. CORS Policy
- If adding API endpoints, configure strict CORS headers
- Allow only trusted origins
- Validate preflight requests

### 6. File Upload Security (if implemented)
- Validate file types and sizes server-side
- Scan for malware
- Store uploads outside web root
- Generate unique filenames

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. **Configure Web Server**
   - [ ] Apply security headers from `.htaccess` or `nginx-security.conf`
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS and force SSL redirect
   - [ ] Configure rate limiting
   - [ ] Hide server version information

2. **API Security**
   - [ ] Implement server-side form handling
   - [ ] Add CSRF protection
   - [ ] Validate and sanitize all inputs server-side
   - [ ] Implement proper authentication if needed

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up security monitoring
   - [ ] Configure error logging (without exposing sensitive data)
   - [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test all security headers with online tools
   - [ ] Verify HTTPS redirect works
   - [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
   - [ ] Check for information disclosure

## Note

All client-side security measures have been implemented. The items listed above require server/hosting configuration and cannot be resolved through code changes alone.
