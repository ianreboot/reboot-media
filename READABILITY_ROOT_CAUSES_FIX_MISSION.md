**Current Focus**: Phase 1, Task 1.1 - Create comprehensive audit of existing CSS accessibility utilities system
**Last Completed**: None yet

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive audits of 30+ pages across the reboot project, we've identified 7 root causes affecting text readability across the entire site. The paradox discovered is that **excellent accessibility infrastructure exists** but **systematic implementation is inconsistent**. This mission will fix all 7 root causes systematically to ensure 100% WCAG AA compliance across all pages.

**The 7 Root Causes:**
1. **Design System Architecture Failure** - Inconsistent adoption of existing accessibility classes
2. **Background Complexity Without Text Protection** - Complex gradients without systematic text enhancement
3. **Missing Accessible Color Palette** - System exists but not consistently applied
4. **CSS Utility Class Gap** - Utilities exist but enforcement missing
5. **Text Enhancement Strategy Missing** - BIGGEST ISSUE - Strategy exists but not systematically applied
6. **Development Workflow Gap** - No accessibility validation in workflow
7. **Content Type Standardization Missing** - Styling application inconsistent across content types

## Methodology
Following LONG_RUNNING_TASK_METHODOLOGY for crash-resistant execution with systematic root cause resolution.

## üìù Document Update Instructions (EXECUTE DURING CONTEXT REFRESH)

### When you reach a üß† CONTEXT REFRESH task, complete these steps:

**Note**: Even if there's "nothing to update" (no tasks completed), still READ the document to refresh your context. The reading IS the value.

**ESSENTIAL UPDATES (Do these first):**
1. **Update Task Checklist**:
   - Find the task you just completed in the checklist
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add `(COMPLETED: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
   - If you encountered issues, add a note under the task

2. **Update Current State Variables**:
   - Go to "Current State Variables" section
   - Update `CURRENT_PHASE` to reflect where you are
   - Set boolean flags based on what's been completed
   - Update file locations if you created new files

3. **Update Progress Log**:
   - Go to "Progress Log" section
   - Add new entry with current date/time
   - Document: What was done, files modified, results, issues, next step

4. **Update Quick Stats** (at top of document):
   - Count completed vs total tasks for percentage
   - Update "Current Phase" 
   - Update "Last Update" with current timestamp
   - Note any new blockers

5. **Document Any Discoveries**:
   - If you found something unexpected, add to "Notes & Observations"

## Implementation Details

### Critical Context
**EVERYTHING a fresh AI needs to know to continue the task**

**Key Information**:
- Project root: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/`
- Main CSS file: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/styles/accessibility-utilities.css` (431 lines, comprehensive)
- Pages directory: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/pages/` (30+ .tsx files)
- Previous audit findings: 7 systematic root causes identified affecting all pages
- Paradox discovered: Excellent accessibility infrastructure exists but inconsistent implementation

**Things That Must Not Change**:
- Existing visual design aesthetics and brand identity
- Current functional behavior and user experience
- Existing accessibility infrastructure (enhance, don't replace)
- File structure and component architecture

**SUCCESS CRITERIA WITH COMPLETION GATES**:
**MANDATORY**: Define specific, measurable criteria that prevent premature completion

**COMPLETION GATE ENFORCEMENT**:
```markdown
**COMPLETION GATE:**
Mission marked complete ONLY when ALL criteria verified:
‚úÖ All 7 root causes systematically fixed across 100% of pages
‚úÖ WCAG AA compliance verified on all 30+ pages with automated testing
‚úÖ Development workflow integration prevents future accessibility regressions
‚úÖ Text readability verified on all gradient/background combinations
‚úÖ Zero ad-hoc styling classes remain - 100% systematic approach
‚úÖ Content type standardization implemented across all similar page types
‚úÖ Accessibility validation workflow integrated into development process

**DEVIATION = MISSION FAILURE**: Any shortcuts or partial implementations invalidate results
```

### ‚úÖ MANDATORY: Success Verification Commands
Every task completion requires:
```bash
# Root Cause Fix Verification
VERIFY_ROOT_CAUSE_1="grep -c 'text-gradient-critical\|text-black-critical' src/pages/*.tsx | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print (sum > 50) ? 0 : 1}'"
VERIFY_ROOT_CAUSE_5="grep -c 'text-shadow\|backdrop-blur' src/styles/*.css | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print (sum > 10) ? 0 : 1}'"

# Universal verification pattern
if eval "$VERIFY_ROOT_CAUSE_1"; then
  echo "‚úÖ Root Cause 1 - Design System systematically implemented"
else
  echo "‚ùå Root Cause 1 failed verification - DO NOT mark complete"
fi
```

**FORCED ITERATION REQUIREMENT**:
```markdown
**RESTART TRIGGERS** - Return to appropriate checkpoint:
- Any root cause not systematically fixed across all pages ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 2
- WCAG AA compliance failures detected ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 3
- Development workflow not properly integrated ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 2
- Content type standardization incomplete ‚Üí RESTART at Phase 3
- Any "partial fix" or "mostly working" ‚Üí RESTART until 100% systematic

**ITERATION TRACKING**:
Add to Current State Variables:
ITERATION_COUNT: 0  # Track restart loops
RESTART_REASON: ""  # Document why restarted  
COMPLETION_GATES_PASSED: false  # Only true when ALL gates verified
```

### Detailed Implementation Guide

#### Phase 1: Foundation Analysis & Strategy

**Step 1.1: Audit Existing CSS Accessibility Utilities**
- File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/styles/accessibility-utilities.css`
- Action: Read and analyze all 431 lines of existing accessibility classes
- Expected Result: Complete understanding of available utilities and gaps
- Verification: `cat /home/ian/projects/reboot/src/styles/accessibility-utilities.css | wc -l` should return ~431

**Step 1.2: Document Current Implementation Patterns**
- Action: Analyze usage patterns across all pages in `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/pages/`
- Command: `grep -r "text-gradient\|text-black\|replace-text" src/pages/ --include="*.tsx" > implementation_patterns.txt`
- Expected Result: Clear map of which pages use systematic vs ad-hoc approaches
- Verification: File contains comprehensive pattern analysis

**Step 1.3: Create Systematic Enforcement Strategy**
- Action: Design strategy to ensure 100% systematic accessibility class usage
- Expected Result: Development workflow integration plan
- Verification: Strategy covers all 7 root causes with specific implementation steps

#### Phase 2: Critical Infrastructure Implementation

**Step 2.1: Enhance CSS Accessibility Utilities**
- File: `/home/ian/projects/reboot/src/styles/accessibility-utilities.css`
- Action: Add missing content-type specific classes and systematic enforcement utilities
- Expected Result: Complete utility coverage for all discovered patterns
- Verification: `grep -c "content-quote\|content-explanation\|content-decision" src/styles/accessibility-utilities.css` returns >0

**Step 2.2-2.5: [Continue implementation following same pattern...]**

## Error Recovery & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**If build fails after CSS changes**:
1. Check CSS syntax: `npm run build` and read error messages
2. Verify no duplicate class names: `grep -n "duplicate" src/styles/*.css`
3. Test with specific page: `npm run dev` and check browser console

**If pages break after accessibility class changes**:
1. Revert last changes: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/pages/[filename].tsx`
2. Apply changes incrementally: Fix one root cause at a time
3. Test each change: Verify visual appearance maintained

### Rollback Procedure
If something goes critically wrong:
1. `git status` to see what changed
2. `git checkout HEAD -- [affected files]` to rollback specific files
3. `npm run build` to verify project still works
4. Document issue in Error Recovery section

- Pages with systematic accessibility: 100% (30/30)
- Pages with text enhancement issues: 0% (0/30)
- Ad-hoc styling instances: 0 across all pages
- WCAG AA compliance rate: 100% verified

## Notes & Observations

### Hard-Fought Knowledge

#### Root Cause Analysis Discovery - 2025-08-17
**Problem**: Widespread readability issues across 30+ pages
**Investigation**: Comprehensive audit of 9 page categories with frontend developers
**Actual Finding**: Paradox - excellent accessibility infrastructure exists but implementation is inconsistent
**Key Insight**: This is a workflow/enforcement problem, not a missing design system problem
**Impact**: Fixing workflow will prevent future regressions

### Critical Implementation Insights
- Accessibility utilities system is sophisticated with WCAG mathematical verification
- Problem is adoption/enforcement, not missing features
- Text enhancement strategy exists but not systematically applied
- Content type standardization is the easiest fix with highest impact
